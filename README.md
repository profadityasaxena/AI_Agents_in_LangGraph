# AI Agent with LangGraph and ReAct Pattern

This project demonstrates the creation of an AI agent using **LangGraph** and the **ReAct Pattern**. The goal is to build a robust and interactive AI system capable of reasoning and acting based on user inputs.

## REACT: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models

**Paper Title:** *REACT: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models*  
**Focus:** Combines language model reasoning capabilities with real-time action-taking (e.g., tool use, external environments).  
**Keywords:** Language Models, Reasoning, Tool Use, Agents, REACT, LLMs, Decision-Making

> A framework that enables language models not just to generate text, but also to interact with tools and environmentsâ€”merging logical reasoning with real-world execution.

## Features

- **LangGraph Integration**: Utilize LangGraph for managing complex workflows and dependencies.
- **ReAct Pattern**: Combine reasoning and acting for dynamic decision-making.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the agent with new capabilities.
- **Interactive**: Engage with the agent through a user-friendly interface.

## Agents
### Agent 1: Custom Agent from Scratch

**Description:**  
Agent 1 is a fully custom-built agent designed from the ground up. It leverages the core principles of the ReAct Pattern and integrates seamlessly with LangGraph to handle complex workflows. This agent serves as a foundational example for creating bespoke AI agents tailored to specific use cases.

**Key Features:**  
- **Custom Logic:** Implements unique reasoning and acting capabilities to address specialized tasks.  
- **LangGraph Integration:** Utilizes LangGraph nodes and edges to define workflows and dependencies.  
- **Extensibility:** Designed to be modular, allowing for easy addition of new tools or functionalities.  
- **Interactive Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for real-time interaction and feedback.

**Use Case Example:**  
Agent 1 can be configured to act as a virtual assistant, capable of scheduling tasks, retrieving information, and interacting with external APIs to perform actions based on user inputs.

**Implementation Details:**  
- **Reasoning:** Uses LangGraph to model decision-making processes.  
- **Acting:** Executes actions by interfacing with external tools and APIs.  
- **Feedback Loop:** Continuously refines its behavior based on user feedback and task outcomes.

This agent serves as a starting point for building more advanced agents in the project.
