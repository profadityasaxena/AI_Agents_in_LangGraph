# AI Agent with LangGraph and ReAct Pattern

This project demonstrates the creation of an AI agent using **LangGraph** and the **ReAct Pattern**. The goal is to build a robust and interactive AI system capable of reasoning and acting based on user inputs.

## REACT: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models

**Paper Title:** *REACT: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models*  
**Focus:** Combines language model reasoning capabilities with real-time action-taking (e.g., tool use, external environments).  
**Keywords:** Language Models, Reasoning, Tool Use, Agents, REACT, LLMs, Decision-Making

> A framework that enables language models not just to generate text, but also to interact with tools and environmentsâ€”merging logical reasoning with real-world execution.

## Features

- **LangGraph Integration**: Utilize LangGraph for managing complex workflows and dependencies.
- **ReAct Pattern**: Combine reasoning and acting for dynamic decision-making.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the agent with new capabilities.
- **Interactive**: Engage with the agent through a user-friendly interface.
